- Functional decomposition arrising from / consisting of  shapley values
    - example calculation for this?
    - bigger exercise: Have students derive this composition in homework themselves (instead of in lecture) ?
    - exercise to compare this decomposition to others known from func decomp chapter



- @ SHAP exercise: additional exercise to calculate Shapley value for ML or calculate SHAP by hand on a toy example



- s. IC exercise comparison with LIME: similarly, an exercise on comparing shapley or SHAP to other FE methods would be good, i.e. comparing results / plots



- Shapley and SHAP for categorical features or classification tasks



- @ current programming exercises: Solutions checked / finished for programming exercises 1 & 2 (Shapley & SHAP)
    still TO DO:
    - 2nd alternative for all_unique_subsets in R solution
    - 1 e) completely (programming exercise checking axioms)
    - programming exercise 3 (LIME) completely
    - 2 b) fct signature: model or predict ?
    - 2 b) in python: vectorize correctly (also for R) ... using np.array and reshaping for observation instead of current implementation
    - 2 d)
        - in python: Either simplify code or explain better
        - Unify LM or GLM in this exercise !
        - in R: shap_data could be extra
    - 2 d)  - f) still TO DO





- idea: SHAP using ALE instead of PD-fcts or M-plots as a value fct. => WOuld that work? How? How to compute? WHat different would it make? What would that intuitively mean?
