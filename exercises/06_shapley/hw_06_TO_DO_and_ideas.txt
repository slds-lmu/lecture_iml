- Functional decomposition arrising from / consisting of  shapley values
    - example calculation for this?
    - bigger exercise: Have students derive this composition in homework themselves (instead of in lecture) ?
    - exercise to compare this decomposition to others known from func decomp chapter



- @ SHAP exercise: additional exercise to calculate Shapley value for ML or calculate SHAP by hand on a toy example



- s. IC exercise comparison with LIME: similarly, an exercise on comparing shapley or SHAP to other FE methods would be good, i.e. comparing results / plots
