- From slide set 1: slides on Banzhaf value as IC exercise

- IC sheet 2, question 2: this is about Shapley values basically, could be moved to 1st sheet
    - In this question, the v is formatted differently than in the lecture + v is not mentioned in the context of SHAP in the lecture slides, so students were confused

- IC sheet 2, question 4: "Does the dependence structure in the DGP influence the SHAP result?" needs refactoring / reworking
    Marginal / conditional is not really the correct answer to this question, becauswe that is a design choice and not a directly implication of the DGP... Maybe the question needs to be reformulated

=> Both IC and HW sheet need more refactoring & cleanup with a clear understanding of the relationships between
    Shapley values <-> SHAP <-> KernelSHAP
