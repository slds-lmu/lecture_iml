\begin{enumerate}
    \item Yes or No: Shapley values and SHAP values are different names for the same concept.
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] Not directly as for calculating SHAP values a (more efficient) estimation procedure is used. The estimated SHAP and Shapley values can be different as Shapley values are often approximated by different procedures.
    \end{itemize}
    \item What are SHAP value functions $v$ in contrast to SHAP values $\phi$?
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] SHAP value function: a function assigning a value to a coalition
    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] SHAP values: Contribution of a feature to a prediction
    \end{itemize}
%    \item What is the difference between marginal and conditional SHAP?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] The features that are not part of the coalition or the feature of interest are sampled from the marginal or the conditional distribution, respectively.
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item What is the motivation of LIME?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] Interpret a model locally by fitting a simple model (independent of the complexity of the global ML model). $\rightarrow$ local surrogate model
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Both SHAP and LIME can be seen as local linear approximations. Name differences between SHAP and LIME.
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] 
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Name hyperparameters for LIME. What do they steer?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] 
%    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
