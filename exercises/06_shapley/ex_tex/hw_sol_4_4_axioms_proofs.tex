    \textbf{Proof of Axioms}
      The Shapley values fulfills all the 4 axioms.
      Symmetry, Dummy and Additivity are relatively easy to proof:
    \begin{itemize}
        % See also: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2747088/shapley-value-is-efficient
      \item \textbf{Symmetry}: Let's assume coalition $\SsubPnojk$ and $v(\Scupj) = v(\Scupk)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Then all marginal contributions are equal: $v(\Scupj) -  v(S) = v(\Scupk) -  v(S), \forall \SsubPnojk$
            \item Consequently, $\phi_j = \phi_k$.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Dummy}: Let's assume we have player $j$ such that for all $\SsubP$, we have $v(S) = v(\Scupj)$. Then, each marginal contribution of player $j$ is zero, and therefore $\phi_j = 0$.
      \item \textbf{Additivity}:  Assume two games $v_1$ and $v_2$ and a third game which is the sum of both $v(S) = v_1(S) + v_2(S)$. The marginal contribution for all $\SsubPnoj$ for game $v$ can be expressed as $v(\Scupj) - v(S) = v_1(\Scupj) - v_1(S) + v_2(\Scupj) - v_2(S)$. Since the Shapley value is additive in the marginal contributions, we can split the sum into two sums so that $\phi_{j,v} = \phi_{j, v_1} + \phi_{j,v_2}$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Proof of Axioms}
    
    Efficiency requires a bit more effort, see proof sketch:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Efficiency}: $v(P)$ exactly appears once per player ($=p$ times) for coalition $S = P \setminus \{j\}$ with the weight $\frac{|P - 1|!(|P| - |P - 1| - 1)!}{|P|!} = \frac{1}{p}$ each. The values for all other coalitions $v(S), \SsubP \{j,k\}$ appear with both minus and plus signs that cancel each other out.
    \end{itemize}
    
    
    \textbf{Linearity Axiom Corollary}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item The Shapley values are also linear:
      \item For a game with payout $v(S) = \alpha v_1(S) + v_2(S)$, the Shapley values are $\alpha \phi_{j,v_1} + \phi_{j,v_2}$.
      \item The multiplication with $\alpha$ works since we can pull out $\alpha$ from the sum of marginal contributions, so that for $v(S) = \alpha v_1(S)$ the Shapley value is $\alpha \phi_{j,v_1}$.
      \item We already know that Shapley values are additive which proofs the linearity.
      \end{itemize}
