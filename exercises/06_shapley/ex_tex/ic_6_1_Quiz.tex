\textbf{Quiz:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the motivating idea behind Shapley values? 
    \item How is this idea realized / implemented in IML?
    \item What is a practical problem of Shapley values and how is it solved?
    \item When not using any approximations, but computing the exact Shapley value, which definition is more useful in practice?
    \item Are Shapley values in ML concerned with the prediction or the prediction target? How do they relate to the model and how to the DGP?
    \item \textbf{Bonus:} To what kind of IML methods do Shapley values belong, or are very similar to? How are they different to other methods in this category?
