\begin{enumerate}
%    \item What is the prediction target in contrast to the prediction?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] The prediction target is the hole set of possible targets whereas the prediction is the concrete output after applying a prediction function.
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item What is the model's mechanism in contrast to the data generating process (DGP)?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$]  The DGP is the true underlying process generating the data. The model is estimated by optimizing the prediction performance, i.e. the model's mechanism tries to be a copy of the DGP but this mostly is not possible.
%    \end{itemize}
	\item What is motivating idea behind Shapley values? 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\Rightarrow$] fairly divide the total achievable payout $v(P)$ among the players according to a playerâ€™s individual contribution
	\end{itemize}
	\item How is the Shapley idea realized / implemented in IML?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\Rightarrow$] players = features, \\game = prediction for a single observation, \\Shapley value = individual payout per player (feature)
		\item[$\Rightarrow$] Calculate marginal contribution for adding a feature to every possible coalition and average the resulting values
	\end{itemize}
	\item What is a practical problem of Shapley values and how is it solved?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\Rightarrow$] Computation for high dimensional feature spaces (large power set $P$, many marginal predictions)
		\item[$\Rightarrow$] Solution: sampling (The more coalitions are sampled, the exacter the computation will be but also more computationally expensive)
	\end{itemize}
    \item Yes or No: Shapley values and SHAP values are different names for the same concept.
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] Not directly as for calculating SHAP values a (more efficient) estimation procedure is used. The estimated SHAP and Shapley values can be different as Shapley values are often approximated by different procedures.
    \end{itemize}
    \item What are SHAP value functions $v$ in contrast to SHAP values $\phi$?
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] SHAP value function: a function assigning a value to a coalition
    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] SHAP values: Contribution of a feature to a prediction
    \end{itemize}
%    \item What is the difference between marginal and conditional SHAP?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] The features that are not part of the coalition or the feature of interest are sampled from the marginal or the conditional distribution, respectively.
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item What is the motivation of LIME?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] Interpret a model locally by fitting a simple model (independent of the complexity of the global ML model). $\rightarrow$ local surrogate model
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Both SHAP and LIME can be seen as local linear approximations. Name differences between SHAP and LIME.
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] 
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Name hyperparameters for LIME. What do they steer?
%    \begin{itemize}
%    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] 
%    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
