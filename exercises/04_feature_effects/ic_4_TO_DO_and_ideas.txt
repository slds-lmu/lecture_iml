quiz for marginal effects
- what different kinds of marginal effects?
- which different advantages / disadvantages to they have
- how are marginal effects different than all the other methods in this chapter?
- in the end, compare different marginal effect methods to ALE
- last quiz task also for fMEs or dMEs



ex_tex/ic_4_2_PDP_ALE_Plot.tex
    DGP used for plots is different from the one given in the task, s. bonus part !!
    => correct this? leave this? Also this plot shows extrapolation issue not super obviously, maybe add another more obvious example (and make this one here the second, "harder" example?)

ex_tex/ic_X_compute_mplot_pdp_ale.tex
    This has correlations and is supposed to show extrapolaiton issue, but actually PDP and centered ALE coincide, so it actually does not show the extrapolation issue
