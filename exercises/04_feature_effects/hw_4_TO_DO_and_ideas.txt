inconsistent notation for linear regression coefficients:
    apparently, in I2ML, in lecture slides and generally use theta  =>  change all beta to theta





In subfolders code/ and rsrc/ the two datasets/ subfolders are the same, could remove one and link instead, or use top-level datasets folder





Best to implement and go through each feature effect method at least once
    Also calculate each one by hand once ?

    => Too much material, moved ALE to a seperate week on its one





To make clear that the first exercise sheet here is about PDP/dME/fME for an already interpretable model just for didactical reasons (and that the methods can be applied to any model):
    - add an applied exercise using both synthetic data (with known nonlinear ground truth & interactions) and real data (e.g. bikesharing?) where they should train an RF, LM, GAM (and maybe EBM) and plot ICE/PDP/c-ICE/c-PDP for each (e.g. using iml package or the self-implemented functions)
