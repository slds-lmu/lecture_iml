inconsistent notation for linear regression coefficients:
    apparently, in I2ML, in lecture slides and generally use theta  =>  change all beta to theta





In subfolders code/ and rsrc/ the two datasets/ subfolders are the same, could remove one and link instead, or use top-level datasets folder





Categorical ALE, part a), PDP, visualization: Not totally clear how to read this plot. Actually. "bad" means high credit risk, so the label of the y-axis "Predicted credit_risk" makes sense for the second "bad" plot, but for the first "good" plot, it's exactly the opposite !





Best to implement and go through each feature effect method at least once
    Also calculate each one by hand once ?

    => Too much material, moved ALE to a seperate week on its one





To make clear that the first exercise sheet here is about PDP/dME/fME for an already interpretable model just for didactical reasons (and that the methods can be applied to any model):
    - add an applied exercise using both synthetic data (with known nonlinear ground truth & interactions) and real data (e.g. bikesharing?) where they should train an RF, LM, GAM (and maybe EBM) and plot ICE/PDP/c-ICE/c-PDP for each (e.g. using iml package or the self-implemented functions)



@ ALE: Develop calculation homework, i.e. calculate an easy example (e.g. linear model) explicitly by hand (analytically), same as or similar to PDP
    or use in-class task for explicitly computing different plots

    anyway, some exercises for hands-on calculating ALE plots are necessary



with real-world or synthetic dataset: use both ALE and PDP implementation and compare, e.g. increase correlation / dependency using a parameter => PDP gets worse and worse following the parameter
