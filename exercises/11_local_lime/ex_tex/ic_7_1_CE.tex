Which of the following statement(s) about counterfactual explanations is/are correct? 
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item In case of only two continuous features, we could directly read of counterfactuals from a prediction surface plot.
        \item Counterfactual explanations are not suitable for people without machine learning knowledge, because reasoning by "What if..." questions are not natural for human beings.
         \item Making use of domain-knowledge encoded in causal graphs, could help to receive more realistic counterfactuals.
        \end{enumerate}
}
