\aufgabe{Counterfactuals: Example}
{
You work for a bank that has an ML model for credit scoring in use. 
According to the GDPR, there is a right for explanation for customers that are scored by the ML model. 
Your job is to handle inquiries from customers that demand an individual explanation. 
Since counterfactual explanations (CE) are especially suitable for the layman, you decide to generate explanations with a CE method.
You received an inquiry from a customer with the following personal and credit characteristics: 

\input{rsrc/table_customer_inquiry.txt} 

The method you have chosen to generate counterfactuals returns multiple counterfactuals for this instance: 

\input{rsrc/table_customer_inquiry_Counterfactuals.txt}


\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Which of these counterfactuals would you like to present to the customer?\\
  \textit{Hint:} Think about the different properties that counterfactuals should fulfill. Note that there is no single correct answer, but several possibilities.
  \item Which of these counterfactuals would you rather hide from the customer? 
  \item Which of these counterfactuals would you like to share with the data scientist responsible for the model? 
\end{enumerate}
