- LIME Implementation exercise (hw_6_2_LIME): We train regressor here for a classification task, right ??!! Shouldn't we train a classifier?
     But we do get better results for the regression model as it currently is, right? Needs to be checked out !



Ideas for Solutions for SHAP vs LIME comparison exercise:
- SHAP only at this point, LIME in neighborhood
    SHAP samples coalitions, LIME samples data points or coalitions (for text / image data: binary vectors are analogous to coalitions)
- SHAP fulfills efficiency, LIME fulfills faithfuolness also in neighborhood
- SHAP is somewhat special case of lime for kernel_width = 0 ??? No, result different !
- LIME faster to compute ??
- SHAP only one kind of model (namely linear) possible, LIME many possibilities
