Things to review on IC-sheet / still TO DO:

- small recap of math. CF algorithms & math. framework (multi-objective optimization & pareto-optimality) may be useful? Or do we not need this for this week's exercises?
- Gower distance / distance measure for target & features for different data types ?
- Visualizations: parallel plot
- Rashomon-effect (also in more generality ??) / non-uniqueness
- missing limitations and caveats
