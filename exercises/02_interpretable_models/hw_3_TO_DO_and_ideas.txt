More implementation for GAMs, boosting, decision rules

EBM & RPF
    - RPF preparation exercise (s. sheet 2) ??

    - bigger  / realistic comparison of EBM and  / or  RPF to more powerful models (RFs & XGBoost)
        => R implementation for RPF exists, but need to make it work first ??
        => For EBM, only python implementation in interpret_ML paket from Microsoft exists => Would need an R wrapper if to by used inside mlr3 (for efficiently integrating into bigger benchmarks / pipelines)
        => very big effort  ?

        - theoretic / proof exercises from the original papers (EBM / RPF)

    - implement EBM from scratch ?  "which is not hard"  ?
        FAST Algo is important part of EBM
        => task to calculate this manually at least once
        => Implement from scratch ?

        

- Exercise to demonstrate Selection Bias in CART  (2 features, both equally important / informative, one with more values is preferred)
    - or integrate this / do this together with performance-interpertability-tradeoff exercise ????
