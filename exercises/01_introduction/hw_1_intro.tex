\textbf{As announced in the lecture, the exercises for this week are about the topics that were not covered anymore in the lecture, namely correlation, dependency, and interactions. Therefore, we recommend watching the respective videos (Chapters 1.4 and 1.5 on the website) first before working on the exercises, although it is also possible to directly do the exercises without having watched the videos.}
