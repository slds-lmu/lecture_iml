Open discussion question. \\
TO DO: Look for some homework or exercise from I2ML where something like this can easily happen or is straightforward, as an example or reference. \\
Ideas:

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Feature selection in I2ML (but this is extra material), which needs feature importance or feature effect methods

\item
Exercises 7 or 8 from I2DL (on CNNs)

\item
Exercise 11 from I2DL (a VAE)

\item
Exercise on Tuning from I2ML (Sheet 11) ? But this is only kNN, is this already interpretable? How big of a demand for interpretability is there in this example?

\item
Exercise on XGBoost from AppML

\item
Exercise on benchmarking (with random forests) from AppML

\end{itemize}
