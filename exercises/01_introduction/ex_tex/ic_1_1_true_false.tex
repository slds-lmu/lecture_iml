Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?  
        	\begin{enumerate}
        	\item Interpretation methods are mainly needed to better explain real world phenomena. 
        	\item Model-agnostic methods need access to gradients to explain a model. 
        	\item If a model-agnostic and a model-specific method are applied on the same ML model, the output of the two methods will be the same.
        	\item While feature effects methods show the influence of a feature on the target, feature importance methods focus on a feature's impact on the model fit.
        	\item In IML we distinguish between global IML methods, which explain the behavior of the model over the entire feature space, and local IML methods, which only explain the prediction of individual observations. 
        	%        \item We can also draw conclusions about feature importance from feature effect methods. 
        	\item Technically, correlation is a measure of \textit{linear} statistical dependence. 
        	\item All in the lecture mentioned measures for correlation and dependencies are limited to continuous random variables.
        	\item Features that have an equal feature effect are correlated. 
        	\item A feature interaction between two features $x_j$ and $x_k$ is apparent if a change in $x_j$ influences the impact of $x_k$ on the target.
        \end{enumerate}
