\aufgabe{}{

Did you ever encounter situations in which you wanted to better understand an ML model you trained or worked with? (In former coursework, internships, projects, ...) For example, where you wanted to better understand the DGP, check whether the model actually learned meaningful or correct conclusions from the data, find out about effects of specific features, or find ways to improve your model? Discuss your experiences with your fellow students.
