Explicitly derive correlation measure or \(R^2\) for non-linear models / generalizations of \(R^2\)



Explicit calculating example for mutual information:

    - for independent variables
    - for dependent variables with correlation coefficient \(\neq 0\)
    - dependent variables with 0 correlation (because not linearly dependent)
    - MI also for categorical variables
