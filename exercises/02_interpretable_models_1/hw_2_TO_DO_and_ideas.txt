- Old Sheet 2 becomes new sheets 2 + 3
    => More implementation in sheet 2, integrate EBM & RPF in sheet 3, move ex. 3 from sheet 2 to sheet 3
    Basic idea: Implement all methods from this chapter once



1

- Exercise to calculate GAM once !!

- Exercise for Interactions in GAM  (to understand GAMs and their failure to capture interactions)
    - Develop an implementation of a GAM with and without interactions, visualize these, calculate definition from chapter 1 via hand to prove that there is actually an interaction  (for a toy example)
    - Also:  implement a LM to compare: LM can learn interaction better, but fails to learn complex relationships



- Exercise to demonstrate that model learns interactions, even though none are present
    - See in Chapter 1.5: This can be done using dependent features? How exactly? How does such a process / how does the DGP look like?



- Exercise on Interpretability-Performance-Tradeoff (in chapter 1, or here in chapter 2 to demonstrate applicability of inherently interpretable models in practice)
    - Here in chapter 2: Exercise to compare low-complexity vs. high-complexity interpretable models (in order to understand that "interpretable models" are not always interpretable, if they are too complex)



To prepare for RPFs or basic exercise for RPFs:
- Given decision tree, determine degree & types of interactions included



2

- Compute or derive standard error in an LM
    If this is not known / forgotten: Use this exercise as recap for standard error

    - Also for other models ?? (logisitic regression, GAMs, trees, ...) ???
