\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Odds for ``high number of bike rentals'' vs. ``low to medium number of bike rentals'' in winter: $$\text{odds} = \frac{P(y=1\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})}{P(y=0\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})} = \frac{7}{174} = 0.04 $$
	\textbf{Interpretation:} In winter the occurrence of \texttt{cnt} $> 5531$ ($y=1$) is $0.04$ times as likely as \texttt{cnt} $\leq 5531$ ($y=0$), the odds are $1:25$, which means $y=0$ is 25 times as likely than $y=1$.
    
	\item Odds Ratio of spring vs. winter: 
	\begin{align*}
		\text{odds ratio} 
		&= \frac{P(y=1\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{SPRING})\,/\,P(y=0\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{SPRING})}{P(y=1\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})\,/\,P(y=0\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})} \\
		&= \frac{73/111}{7/174} = 16.35
	\end{align*}

    For summer we get
    \[
    \text{odds ratio} 
    = \frac{P(y=1\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{SUMMER})\,/\,P(y=0\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{SUMMER})}{P(y=1\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})\,/\,P(y=0\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})}
    = \frac{90/98}{7/174} = 22.83,
    \]

    and for fall:
    \[
    \text{odds ratio} 
    = \frac{P(y=1\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{FALL})\,/\,P(y=0\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{FALL})}{P(y=1\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})\,/\,P(y=0\, | \,\texttt{season}=\text{WINTER})}
    = \frac{50/128}{7/174} = 9.71.
    \]
    
	\textbf{Interpretation:} The chances (the odds) of having "high bike rentals" are $16.35$ times higher in season SPRING compared to the reference category (WINTER).
    As in winter the odds of $y=0$ are $25:1$, this means in spring they are roughly $(25:16):1$, which means roughly $5:3$.
    Similarly, in summer the odds are $22.83$ times higher that in winter, which means that in summer they are close to $1:1$ (since in winter they were $1:25$), so the chances in summer are roughly 50-50.

	\item Table:
	\begin{table}[!ht]

		\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
			\hline
			& Estimate & Std. Error & Pr($>$$|$z$|$) \\ 
			\hline
			(Intercept) & -3.2131 & 0.3854 & 0.0000 \\ 
			seasonSPRING & 2.7941 & 0.4138 & 0.0000 \\

			seasonFALL & 2.2731 & 0.4199 & 0.0000 \\ 
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	The intercept gives the odds for ``high number of bike rentals'' vs. ``low to medium number of bike rentals'' for the default category, in winter: exp$(-3.2131) = 0.04$. Interpretation as in a).
	
	Regarding the estimate of seasonSPRING (and analogous for all the other seasons): $\text{odds ratio (when season changes from winter to spring)} = \text{exp}(2.7941) =  16.35$. Interpretation as in b).
    
	\item Table:	
	\begin{table}[ht]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
			\hline
			& Estimate & Std. Error & Pr($>$$|$z$|$) \\ 
			\hline
			(Intercept) & -8.5176 & 1.2066 & 0.0000 \\ 
			seasonSPRING & 1.7427 & 0.5977 & 0.0035 \\ 
			seasonSUMMER & -0.8566 & 0.7660 & 0.2635 \\ 
			seasonFALL & -0.6417 & 0.5543 & 0.2470 \\ 
			temp & 0.2902 & 0.0391 & 0.0000 \\

		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	If all features are considered in the model, the $\beta$-value for the intercept is higher in absolute terms, but the odds changes to exp($-8.5176) = 0.0002$, i.e. the probability of ``high number of bike rentals'' is even less in winter when considering the full model compared to the one only containing feature \texttt{season}. Also, the higher chance of having "high bike rentals" in season SPRING compared to WINTER declined to exp($1.7427)=5.71$ (vs. $16.35$ in the smaller model).
