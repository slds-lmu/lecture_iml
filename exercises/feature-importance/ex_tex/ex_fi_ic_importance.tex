\aufgabe{Feature importance and extrapolation}{
Based on the results in Exercise \ref{ex:factorizing}, explain why and when the different feature importance methods extrapolate.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Over which distributions does PFI evaluate the model? Under which assumptions is the model evaluated outside the domain?
    \item Over which distributions does CFI evaluate the model? What about SAGE? Do the methods extrapolate?
    \item For both PFI and CFI evaluate whether/when the perturbed variables are dependent/independent of the target variable.
    \item What does that mean for the interpretation of PFI and CFI?
    \item Can a feature be relevant for CFI but not relevant for PFI?
\end{enumerate}
}
