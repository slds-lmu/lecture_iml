(a) Over $P(x_j)P(x_{-j})$. If dependence $x_j \not \perp x_{-j}$ then extrapolation.
(b) Over $P(x)$. They do not extrapolate. (assuming conditional SAGE).
(c) For PFI the perturbation (perturbed variable) $\tilde{X}_j$ is always independent of the target variable (and any other variable). For CFI that is only the case when the remaining variables do not allow restoring dependence between $x_j$ and $y$.
(d) CFI is zero when $X_j \per Y | X_-j$, which is not necessarily the case for PFI.
