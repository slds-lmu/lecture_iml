(a) Both PFI and CFI may be used, however careful interpretation required. For PFI The model is evaluated outside the domain, however we get a better understanding of which variables are mechanistically used. For CFI model is only evaluated within the domain, however even though a feature is mechanistically used CFI may be zero due to conditional independence in the data. SAGE value functions only evaluate the method within the domain and therefore are suitable to expose the behaviour of the model in its normal surrounding, plus not only nonzero of conditional dependence. All methods assess feature importance and therefore filter for the usefulness for prediction, irrespective of whether the prediction is affected by changes in input.
(b) conditional sampling based method
(i) v(j)
(ii) CFI or v(R cup j) - v(R)
(iii) in general no method conclusive, further assumptions necessary
