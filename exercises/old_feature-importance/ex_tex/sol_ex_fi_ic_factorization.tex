(a) We cannot factorize the distribution like that, because $P(x_S, x_{-S}) \neq P(x_S, x_{-S})$ unless there is an independence $x_S \perp x_{-S}$.
(b) Yes, because $P(x_S, x_{-S}) = P(x_S|x_{-S})P(x_{-S})$. Given independence $P(x_S|x_{-S}) = P(x_S)$ and therefore equivlaence.
(c) E.g. the illustrations for marginal and conditional from the lecture.
