    \item Yes or No: Shapley values and SHAP values are different names for the same concept.
    \item What are SHAP value functions $v$ in contrast to SHAP values $\phi$?
    \item What is the difference between marginal and conditional SHAP?
    %\item What is the difference between kernel SHAP and tree SHAP?
    \item Does the dependence structure in the DGP influence the SHAP result?
    \item What is the motivation of LIME?
    \item Both SHAP and LIME can be seen as local linear approximations. Name differences between SHAP and LIME.
    \item Name hyperparameters for LIME. What do they steer?
