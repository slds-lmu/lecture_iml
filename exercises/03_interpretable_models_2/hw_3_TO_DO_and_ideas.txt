GAM

- Exercise to calculate / implement GAM once
    -> done by exercise 3-2 ? Or more complex one / more complex dataset wanted?

- Exercise 3-2 for Interactions in GAMs
    still TO DO: Visualize all the different models (both the LMs and the GAMs)
        evtl. also give the DGP formula, so that another task can be to prove via hand that there is actually an interaction ??  Or this maybe for a little more complex example ? (see also ideas for exercise 1-3)
    TO DO: Tailor single tasks more to single data sets



Boosting

@ Exercise 3-1: little more complex (more features to interpret)



RPF
- s. RPF preparation exercise inside exercise 2-4 (CART implementation)

- bigger  / realistic comparison of EBM and  / or  RPF to more powerful models (RFs & XGBoost)
    => R implementation for RPF exists, but need to make it work first ??
    => For EBM, only python implementation in interpret_ML paket from Microsoft exists => Would need an R wrapper if to by used inside mlr3 (for efficiently integrating into bigger benchmarks / pipelines)
    => very big effort  ?

    - or implement or run different variants (of RPF or of RFs or of XGBoost), i.p. variants with different depths    =>   see interaction-vs-performance tradeoff exercise in Ch. 1

    
EBM:
- implement EBM from scratch ?  "which is not hard"  ?
    FAST Algo is important part of EBM
    => task to calculate this manually at least once
    => Implement from scratch ?



- theoretic / proof exercises from the original papers (EBM / RPF)



- "Interpretability vs Performance" tradeoff exercise from chapter 1
    -> could be done with one of the models in this chapter ???
