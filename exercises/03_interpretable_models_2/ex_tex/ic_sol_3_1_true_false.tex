Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?  
	\begin{enumerate}
        \item Explain the feature importance provided by model-based boosting. What is the difference from the (Gini / L2) feature importance from decision trees?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[$\Rightarrow$] Two differences:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Technically, the feature importances at single nodes inside decision tree need to be weighted, whereas for boosting they can be simply summed up.
                \item The importance in a decision tree is only in a single tree, a single model, whereas in boosting it's a sum over several models (e.g. several trees).
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
    	
	\end{enumerate}
