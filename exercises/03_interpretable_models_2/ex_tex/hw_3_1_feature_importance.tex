	You are again given the bike sharing dataset. The target variable \texttt{cnt} is renamed in $y$ and the only features considered are \texttt{days\_since\_2011} and \texttt{temp}.
	A linear model with a single feature (including the intercept) is estimated as a base learner (BL). The changes in risk (MSE) in each iteration are given in the following tables:
    % Isn't this actually SSE ??
		
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{clrr}
			\hline
			iteration & base learner & old\_risk & new\_risk \\ 
			\hline
			1 & days\_since\_2011 & 1 873 827.22 & 1 733 044.28 \\ 
			2 & temp & 1 733 044.28 & 1 597 057.93 \\ 
			3 & days\_since\_2011 & 1 597 057.93 & 1 486 743.19 \\ 
			4 & temp & 1 486 743.19 & 1 379 888.98 \\ 
			5 & temp & 1 379 888.98 & 1 293 337.07 \\

	Calculate the feature importance of the two features and interpret the result.
