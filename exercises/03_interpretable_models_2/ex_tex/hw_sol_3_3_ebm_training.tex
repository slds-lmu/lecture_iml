This exercise continues exercise \ref{ex_sol:GAM_interactions_EBM_1} and shows how EBMs can learn complex structures but still regain a high degree of interpretability through the visualizations of the single components.

The third data set is designed particularly for EBMs.

Note also that the default settings for the EBMs in the package are very high (high number of boosting iterations, etc.), easily leading to overfitting in this exercise.
It is helpful to set these values to lower values (e.g. only 2 - 3 iterations) to make the EBM model more comparable to the other models used here.
