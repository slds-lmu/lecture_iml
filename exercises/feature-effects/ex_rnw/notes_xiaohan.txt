* <- vs. = 
* X[, s, 1], but X[, s] is enough
* vector() --> c() is also ok
* instead of 1:length(uncentered_ale) you can simply use seq_along(uncentered_ale)
* mapply in prepare_ale() works totally fine, but I replaced it with rowMeans() which simplifies it a lot.
* Doku of functions: int --> integer(1), the (1) reflects the allowed length, so not a vector of integers is allowed.
* boolean --> logical is the terminus in R
