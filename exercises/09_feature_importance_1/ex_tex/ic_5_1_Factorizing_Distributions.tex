\aufgabe{Factorizing distributions}{
\label{ex:factorizing}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can we factorize the joint distribution $\P(x)$ as $\P(x_S)\P(x_{-S})$? How can we factorize the joint distribution, such that the distribution is preserved? Formally prove your answer.
    \item Let $x_S \perp x_{-S}$. Does the factorization preserve the joint now? Formally prove your answer.
    \item Illustrate the two factorizations in a schematic drawing. \textit{Hint:} You can draw a 2D scatterplot with two dependent variables. Given a fixed value for the conditioned variable, draw the range of values that conditional and marginal sampling consider.
\end{enumerate}
