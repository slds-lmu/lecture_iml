	We can also assess the importance of a feature by refitting the model without access to the feature of interest and comparing the respective predictive performance.
    This method is also referred to as leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) feature importance.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement LOCO. 
    Again, reuse your functions from Exercise~\ref{ex:pfi}.
    \item Apply LOCO to the dataset from Exercise \ref{ex:pfi} (again using an unregularized OLS model).
    \item Interpret the results (w.r.t. insights into model and data). Compare the results to PFI and CFI. % and conditional SAGE value functions.
\end{enumerate}
