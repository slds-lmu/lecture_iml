Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?  
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Interpretation methods are mainly needed to better explain real world phenomena. 
        \item Model-agnostic methods need access to gradients to explain a model.
        \item In IML we distinguish between global IML methods, which explain the behavior of the model over the entire feature space, and local IML methods, which only explain the prediction of individual observations. 
        \item We can also draw conclusions about feature importance from feature effect methods.
        \item Technically, correlation is a measure of \textit{linear} statistical dependence.
        \item Features that have an equal feature effect are correlated.
        \end{enumerate}
