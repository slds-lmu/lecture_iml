\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the problem of PDP when interactions between features are present? How about extrapolation?
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item[$\Rightarrow$] When interactions are apparent, the effects may in average cancel each other out, i.e. PDP shows no effect.
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] Extrapolation can cause issues in regions with few observations or if features are correlated, i.e. resulting data point may be unrealistic or very unlikely.
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
