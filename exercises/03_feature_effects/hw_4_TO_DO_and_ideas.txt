- Calculate standard fANOVA by hand (for independent variables)
    - Also calculate an example, where some function is given with an (obvious) decomposition, but the fANOVA does not recover this given decomposition, instead arrives at a different one
        Or does this pheanomenon require dependent variables  ??



- proofs on fANOVA, as we do not cover them in the lecture slides
