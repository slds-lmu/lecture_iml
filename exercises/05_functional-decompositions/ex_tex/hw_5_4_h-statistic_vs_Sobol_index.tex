\section*{Exercise 10 — Comparing $H$ and Sobol indices}
\label{ex:H_vs_Sobol_improved}

For the family
\[
f_\gamma(x,y)=x + y + \gamma\,x\,y,
\quad
x,y\sim U(0,1)\ \text{independent},
\]
we have two measures of interaction strength:

1. Froedman’s $H$‐statistic (see Exercise~\ref{ex:H_param}), which for this model
   can be shown to satisfy
   \[
   H(\gamma) = \frac{|\gamma|}{\sqrt{\gamma^2 + 6}}.
   \]

2. The total‐order Sobol index for $X$ (or $Y$),
   \[
   S_{T,x}(\gamma)
   = 1 - \frac{\text{Var}\bigl(\E[f_\gamma\mid Y]\bigr)}{\text{Var}(f_\gamma)}
   = 1 - \frac{1/12}{\,2/12 + \gamma^2/36\,}
   = 1 - \frac{1}{\,1 + \gamma^2/6\,}.
   \]

\begin{enumerate}%[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Derive the formula $H(\gamma)=|\gamma|/\sqrt{\gamma^2+6}$ by
        repeating the steps in Exercise~\ref{ex:H_param}.
  \item Derive the expression for $S_{T,x}(\gamma)$ as above.
  \item Show that both $H(\gamma)$ and $S_{T,x}(\gamma)$ are strictly
        increasing in $|\gamma|$, and hence induce the same ranking of
        interaction strength.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Hint}
Both measures depend only on $|\gamma|$.  Compare their derivatives
with respect to $|\gamma|$.
