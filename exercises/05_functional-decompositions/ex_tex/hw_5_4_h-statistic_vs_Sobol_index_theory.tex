\aufgabe{Comparing H-statistic and Sobol indices}{
\label{ex:H_vs_Sobol_comparison_theory}

What is the (mathematical) relationship between Friedman's H-statistic of a specific interaction and the Sobol index for this interaction?
You can first look at the cases of two-way and three-way interactions discussed in the lecture, and then at the general case.
