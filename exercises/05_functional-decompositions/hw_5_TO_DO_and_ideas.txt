- Calculate standard fANOVA by hand (for independent variables)
    - @ fANOVA for categorical features: A little too easy? Better with specific coefficients / specific terms in \hat{f} which cancel out in the end, for forcing many terms to be 0 ?

    - Also calculate an example, where some function is given with an (obvious) decomposition, but the fANOVA does not recover this given decomposition, instead arrives at a different one
        -> see lecture slides & in-class tasks



- Calculate fANOVA for an easy classification example, best with multiclass classification
    Maybe add a similar example on the PDP sheet, calculating a PDP or ALE or similar for a categorical target ?



- proofs on fANOVA, as we do not cover them in the lecture slides



- good examples for exercises for fDecompositions in appendix of some / of one Hooker paper ?



- @ standard fANOVA: Same exercise / same example as in exercise for PDPs, pick up same example at this point, once independent variables, once correlated, once uncorrelated but dependent, showcasing problem of standard fANOVA in this case ?



- exercises from proofs in REPID / GADGET papers



- glex Aufgaben





- Implement fANOVA:
    - standard fANOVA using some package
    - standard fANOVA from scratch, using the implementation exercise on PDPs!
    - ALE functional decomposition using some package ??
    - ALE functional decomposition from scratch, using the former exercise implementing ALE

    => See exercise 6.3 on this, still TO DO
