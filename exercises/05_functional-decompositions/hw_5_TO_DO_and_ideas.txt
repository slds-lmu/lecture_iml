- Calculate standard fANOVA by hand (for independent variables)
    - Also calculate an example, where some function is given with an (obvious) decomposition, but the fANOVA does not recover this given decomposition, instead arrives at a different one
        Or does this pheanomenon require dependent variables  ??



- proofs on fANOVA, as we do not cover them in the lecture slides



- good examples for exercises for fDecompositions in appendix of some / of one Hooker paper ?



- @ standard fANOVA: Same exercise / same example as for PDPs, pick up same example at this point, once independent variables, once correlated, once uncorrelated but dependent



- exercises from proofs in REPID / GADGET papers
