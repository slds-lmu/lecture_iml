- Calculate standard fANOVA by hand (for independent variables)
    - Also calculate an example, where some function is given with an (obvious) decomposition, but the fANOVA does not recover this given decomposition, instead arrives at a different one
        -> see lecture slides & in-class tasks



- proofs on fANOVA, as we do not cover them in the lecture slides



- good examples for exercises for fDecompositions in appendix of some / of one Hooker paper ?



- @ standard fANOVA: Same exercise / same example as in exercise for PDPs, pick up same example at this point, once independent variables, once correlated, once uncorrelated but dependent, showcasing problem of standard fANOVA in this case ?



- exercises from proofs in REPID / GADGET papers



- glex Aufgaben





- Implement fANOVA:
    - standard fANOVA using some package
    - standard fANOVA from scratch, using the implementation exercise on PDPs!
    - ALE functional decomposition using some package ??
    - ALE functional decomposition from scratch, using the former exercise implementing ALE

    => See exercise 6.3 on this, still TO DO
