   \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item (Generalized) linear models (LM, GLM)
  \item Generalized additive models (GAM)
  \item Decision trees
  \item Rule-based learning
  \item Model-based / component-wise boosting

        \item Interpretable models are transparent by design, making many model-agnostic explanation methods unnecessary\\
        %For inherently interpretable models some additional model-agnostic interpretation methods not required \\
        $\leadsto$ Eliminates an extra source of estimation error
        \item They often have few hyperparameters and are structurally simple (e.g., linear, additive, sparse, monotonic)\\
$\leadsto$ Easy to train, fast to tune, and straightforward to explain
        % \item Interpretable models often simple \\
        % $\leadsto$ training time is fairly small
        % \item Some interpretable models estimate monotonic effects \\
        % %the monotonicity constraint \\
        % $\leadsto$ Simple to explain as larger feature values always lead to higher (or smaller) outcomes (e.g., GLMs)
        \item Many people are familiar with simple interpretable models \\
        $\leadsto$ Increases trust, facilitates communication of results
        %\item Implementations are available in many programming languages \\
        %$\leadsto$ Simple models are easier to deploy in practice or implement from scratch

\begin{columns}[totalwidth=\textwidth]
\begin{column}{0.75\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}%[<+->]
    \itemsep1em
        \item<1-> Often require assumptions about data / model structure \\%Often certain assumptions about data / model structure required\\
        $\leadsto$ If assumptions are wrong, models may perform bad 
        %\item In high-dimensional settings, it may not be feasible to find and define all feature relationships
        %\item If the wrong assumptions are made, interpretable models may have a bad predictive performance
        %\pause
        \item<2-> Interpretable models may also be hard to interpret, e.g.:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LM with lots of features and interactions 
        \item Decision trees with huge tree depth

        %No automatic modeling of complex relationships due to limited model flexibility
        Often do not automatically model complex relationships due to limited flexibility
        \\
        e.g., high-order main or interaction effects need to be specified manually in an LM

        %\pause
     \item<4-> Inherently interpretable models do not address all explanation needs\\
$\leadsto$ Complementary model-agnostic methods (e.g., counterfactuals) remain valuable for specific tasks
     % Inherently interpretable models do not provide all types of explanations
     % %% one might be interested

     % $\leadsto$ Methods providing other types of explanations still useful  (e.g., counterfactual explanations)
     %Methods providing other types of explanations still useful  (e.g., counterfactual explanations)

\begin{frame}{Further Comments}

    \begin{itemize}
    %\itemsep1em
        \item<1-> Some researchers advocate for inherently interpretable models instead of explaining black boxes after training \citebutton{Rudin 2019}{https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0048-x}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Built-in interpretation $\Rightarrow$ fewer risks from misleading post-hoc explanations
        
            %\item \ldots instead of explaining uninterpretable models post-hoc
            % \item Can sometimes work out by spending enough time and energy on data pre-processing or manual feature engineering
            \item  Good performance possible with effort on preprocessing / feat. engineering
    \item But interpretability depends on meaning of created features\\
    $\leadsto$ E.g., PCA keeps models linear, but yields hard-to-interpret components
            %, or data cleaning
        \end{itemize}
        %\pause
        %\footnote[frame]{Rudin, C. Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead. Nat Mach Intell 1, 206–215 (2019).}
        % {https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0048-x}
       %\item Interpretable models also have the potential for a high predictive performance, but require more knowledge and time spent on data preprocessing
       % \item<2->[$\leadsto$] Drawback: Hard to achieve for data for which end-to-end learning is crucial\\ 
       % $\leadsto$ e.g., hard to extract good features for image / text data\\ 
       % $\leadsto$ information loss can lead to bad performance
      \item<2-> Limitation: Less suited for complex data where end-to-end learning is crucial
\begin{itemize}
    \item Applies to image, text, or sensor data where features must be learned %from raw input
    \item Manual extraction of interpretable features is difficult \\$\Rightarrow$ Information loss and lower performance
\end{itemize}
       %(e.g., for image / text data extraction of good features is hard $\leadsto$ information loss = bad performance)
       %(e.g., image and text data would require good feature extraction steps $\leadsto$ information loss)
        %\pause
        %\item One can assume a trade-off between interpretability and model performance which generally (but not always) holds
        %\item<3-> Often there is a trade-off between interpretability and model performance 
        %(but not always)

\begin{frame}{Recommendation}
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Start with most simple model that makes sense for application at hand
    %     \item Gradually increase complexity if performance is insufficient\\
    %     $\leadsto$ will usually lower interpretability and require additional interpretation methods
    %     \item Choose the most simple, sufficient model (Occam's razor)
    % \end{itemize} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Begin with the simplest model appropriate for the task
    \item Increase complexity only if necessary to meet performance requirements\\
    $\leadsto$ Typically reduces interpretability and requires model-agnostic explanations
    \item Choose the simplest model with sufficient accuracy 
    $\leadsto$ Occam’s razor
