\begin{frame}{Overview of Methods}
	Currently, multiple methods exist to calculate counterfactuals. They mainly differ in: 
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item \textbf{Targets:} Most methods focus on classification models, only few cover regression models\\
		$\leadsto$ so far, all methods remain in the supervised learning paradigm
		\item \textbf{Data:} Methods mainly focus on tabular data, few on visual/text data, none on audio data
		\item \textbf{Feature space:} Some methods can only handle numerical features, few can process mixed (numerical and discrete) feature spaces
		\item \textbf{Objectives:} Many methods focus on action guidance, plausibility and sparsity, few on other objectives like fairness or individual preferences
		\item \textbf{Model access:} Methods either require access to complete model internals, access to gradients, or only to prediction functions $\Rightarrow$ Model-agnostic and model-specific methods exist
		\item \textbf{Optimization tool:} Gradient-based algorithms (only for differentiable models), mixed-integer programming (only linear), or gradient-free algorithms e.g. Nelder-Mead, genetic algorithm
		\item \textbf{Rashomon Effect:} Many methods return a single counterfactual per run, some multiple counterfactuals, others prioritize CEs or let the user choose
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{First Optimization Method \citebutton{Wachter et. al (2018)}{http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3063289}}
Introduced counterfactual explanations in the context of ML predictions by solving
		\begin{equation}
			\argmin_{\xv'} \max_{\lambda} \lambda \underbrace{(\fh(\xv') - y')^2}_{o_p(\fh(\xv'), y')} + \underbrace{\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^p |x'_j - x_j|/MAD_j}_{o_f(\xv', \xv)}
			%\label{eq:wachter}
		\end{equation}
	$MAD_j$ is the median absolute deviation of feature $j$. In each iteration, optimizers like Nelder-Mead solve the equation for $\xv'$ and then $\lambda$ is increased until a sufficiently close solution is found \\[0.2cm]
	
	%\pause
	
	This optimization problem has several shortcomings: 	
	\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
		\item We do not know how to choose $\lambda$ a priori 
		\item Due to the maximization of $\lambda$, we focus primarily on the minimization of $o_p$\\
		$\leadsto$ only if $\fh(\xv') = y'$, we focus on minimizing $o_f$ 
		\item Definition of $o_f$ only covers numerical features 
		\item Other objectives such as sparsity and plausibility of counterfactuals are neglected
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Multi-Objective Counterfactual Explanations \citebutton{Dandl et al. (2020)}{https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11165}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Multi-Objective Counterfactual Explanations (MOC):} Instead of collapsing objectives into a single objective, we could optimize all four objectives simultaneously
	$$	\argmin_{\xv'} \left(o_p(\fh(\xv'), y'), o_f(\xv', \xv), o_s(\xv', \xv), o_4(\xv', \Xmat) \right). $$
		
		\item Note that weighting parameters like $\lambda$ are not necessary anymore
		%\item This approach is called Multi-Objective Counterfactual Explanations (MOC) and was developed by Dandl et al. in 2020. 
		\item Uses an adjusted multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to produce a set of diverse counterfactuals for mixed discrete and continuous feature spaces
		\item Instead of one, MOC returns multiple counterfactuals that represents different trade-offs between the objectives and are constructed to be diverse in feature space

\begin{frame}{Problems, Pitfalls, \& Limitations}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item \textbf{Illusion of model understanding:} 
    CEs explain ML decisions by pointing to few specific alternatives which reduces complexity, but is limited in explanatory power\\
    $\leadsto$ %psychologists showed that even though the perceived model-understanding of end-users increases, the objective model-understanding remained unchanged
    Psychologists have shown that although perceived model understanding of end-users increases, the objective model understanding remains unchanged
    
    %\item \textbf{Finding the right metric:} Similarity is the crucial concept for finding good CEs. However, our concept of similarity is context and domain dependent. E.g. while L1 can be a reasonable notion for tabular data, it is counterintuitive for image data. Sparsity is often desirable for end-users but not for data scientists searching for biases in the model.
    \item \textbf{Right metric:} Similarity measures are crucial to find good CEs (depends on context/domain)\\
    $\leadsto$ e.g., $L_1$ can be reasonable for tabular data but not for image data\\
    $\leadsto$ sparsity can be desirable for end-users but not for data scientists searching for model bias

    %\item \textbf{Confusing Model and Real-World:} Explanations of the model do not easily transfer to the process in which a model is applied. This information should be conveyed to the end-user.
    \item \textbf{Confusing Model and Real-World:} Model explanations are not easily transferable to reality\\
    $\leadsto$ End-users need to be aware that CE provide insights into a model not the real world %models are only approximations %This information should be conveyed to the end-user
    \item \textbf{Disclosing too much information:} \\
    CEs can reveal too much information about the model and help potential attackers
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problems, Pitfalls, \& Limitations}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item \textbf{Rashomon effect:} One, few, all? Which CEs should be shown to the end-user?\\
    $\leadsto$ No perfect solution, depends on end-users computational resources and knowledge
    \item \textbf{Actionability vs. fairness:} Some authors suggest to focus only on the actionability of CEs\\
    $\leadsto$ Counteract contestability, e.g., if ethnicity is not changed in a CE since it is not actionable, this could hide racial biases in the model
    \item \textbf{Assumption of constant model:} To provide guidance for the future, CEs assume that their underlying model does not change in the future\\
    $\leadsto$ in reality this assumption is often violated and CEs are not reliable anymore 
    \item \textbf{Attacking CEs:} Researchers can create models with great performance, which generate arbitrary explanations specified by the ML developer\\
    $\leadsto$ how faithful are CEs to the models underlying mechanism?
\end{itemize}

%	\textbf{Pitfall 3:} Rashomon Effect
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Due to the Rashomon Effect, multiple counterfactual explanations could be found for an instance. 
%		\item If all counterfactuals are reported the user could be overwhelmed. Instead of a comprehensible explanations for a prediction, users received an even more complex explanations.
%		\item Another option is to only report the ``best" ones. But this requires a notion for ``superiority".  
%		\item Furthermore, users might not be interested in the ``best" but most ``diverse" counterfactuals.
%		\item The best option might be to report all counterfactuals but let the user decide which one to select, e.g., based on their previous knowledge. 
%	\end{itemize}
%	\textbf{Pitfall 4:} 
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item 
%	\end{itemize}
%	\textbf{Pitfall 5:} Confusing model explanation with real data process explanations
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Causal dependencies
%		\item Fixed model at time $t$ 
%		\item Wrong input by user
