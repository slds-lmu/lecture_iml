\begin{frame}{ADE and Counterfactual Explanations}
It seems as if ADEs and counterfactual explanations (CEs) are defined similarly. Both ADEs and CEs describe inputs close to a given input $\xv$ that gets a different assignment. What are their differences?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Counterfactuals do not have to be misclassified.
%    \item Counterfactuals should be maximally close to $\xv$.
    \item Different notions of distance $\|\cdot\|$ are applied, e.g., $p_{2,\infty}$-norm for ADEs or $p_{0,1}$-norm for CEs.
    \item Informal difference I: ADEs are mostly considered for high-dimensional data, while CEs are mostly considered in the context of low-dim. data.
    \item Informal difference II: ADEs hide changes while CEs highlight them.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf``If you had two more pets, your loan application would have been granted" is an example of both ADEs and CEs.
