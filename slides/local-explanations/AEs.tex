% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{vbframe}{Adversarial Machine Learning}
Computer systems must be \emph{robust}, that means they have to be able to cope with errors during execution.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Adversarial ML} is the field that studies the robustness of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to malicious input.
\item We differentiate between three different kind of attacks, Evasion, Poisoning, and Model Stealing.
\item \emph{Evasion attacks} allow to mislead an employed ML model with manipulated inputs. These attacks are at focus in this lecture.
\item In \emph{Poisoning}, an attackers enters malicious inputs in the training dataset.
\item \emph{Model Stealing} encompass methods by which an attacker can recover a model or the data it was trained on.
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Adversarial Examples}
The inputs by which evasion attacks can be conducted are called \emph{Adversarial Examples (AEs)}
\begin{itemize}
\item An AE is an input to a model that is deliberately designed to "fool" the model into misclassifying it.
\item AEs occur even for ML algorithms with very high accuracy scores on a test-set.
\item Deep Learning (DL) algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particular vulnerable to such attacks, but, classical ML models are often too [cite Dalvi].
\item AEs that are created from a real data instance $x$ are often indistinguishable from $x$ by a human observer. Such cases suggest that even models with a very good test set performance have no deep understanding of the underlying concepts.% that determine the correct output label.
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

Column three, shows the summation of the original inputs plus the noisy input multiplied by a small scalar. The resulting data-points are AEs as they are assigned the wrong label.}

\begin{vbframe}{Example: Tabular Data Setup}
For tabular data scenarios it is difficult to define e.g. the ground-truth or imperceptibility. Expert knowledge is required in evaluation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experts focus on the most important features in their judgment.
%    \item Tabular features have specific natural ranges that must be respected.
    \item An AE arises from manipulating features the model deems important but the expert does not.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{The image depicts the decision boundary of a classifier that decides about loan applications.}
  \label{fig:mnist}
\end{figure} 
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{AEs and Interpretability}
From the examples we can see that AEs pose security threats on the use of ML algorithms in real-world applications. But what do they have to do with interpretability?

\begin{itemize}
    \item AEs show where models fail and can therefore increase the understanding of the constructor of the model.
    \item AEs motivate the need for interpretability.
    \item Interpretation techniques can provide insight of how to improve ML algorithms and make them more robust against AEs.
    \item Explanations to end-users may enclose too much information about the used model. This information can be used to build adversarial attacks.
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Formal Definition}
\begin{block}{Adversarial Input}
Let $\epsilon>0$, $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be an ML model, $y'\in Y$ be a desired output, and $x\in X$ be an input correctly classified i.e. $f(x)=y_{x,true}$. We call $a_x$ an \emph{adversarial input} to $x$ if:
\begin{equation*}
    \| a_{x}- x\|<\epsilon\text{ and } f(a_{x})\neq y_{a_x,true}=f(x).
\end{equation*}
Moreover, we call $a_x$ \emph{targeted} if $f(a_{x})=y'$.
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intuitively speaking an adversarial is a data-point close to a real, correctly classified input that is misclassified.
    \item It is called targeted if the class it is assigned to is determined.
    \item An AE is the depiction of such an input in visual/textual/etc. form. 
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}


\begin{vbframe}{AEs and Counterfactual Explanations}
It seems as if AEs are defined very similarly to Counterfactual Explanations (CEs). Both, adversarials and counterfactuals describe inputs close to a given input $x$ that gets a different assignment. What are the differences?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Counterfactuals do not have to be misclassified.
    \item Counterfactuals should be maximally close to $x$.
    \item Different notions of distance $\|\cdot\|$ are applied e.g. $p_{2,\infty}$-norm for AEs $p_{0,1}$-norm for CEs.
    \item Informal Difference I: AEs are largely considered for high-dimensional data, while CEs mostly in the context of low-dimensional data.
    \item Informal Difference II: AEs hide changes while CEs highlight them.
    \item \emph{Joint Example:} If you had two more pets, your loan application would have been granted.
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Why Exist AEs?}
There are many hypotheses about why AEs occur. We present a non-exhaustive list in historic order:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low-Probability Spaces Hypotheses:} AEs live in low-probability yet dense spaces in the data manifold that are not represented in the training samples.
    %@article{szegedy2013intriguing,
 % title={Intriguing properties of neural networks},
 % author={Szegedy, Christian and Zaremba, Wojciech and Sutskever, Ilya and Bruna, Joan and Erhan, Dumitru and Goodfellow, Ian and Fergus, Rob},
 % journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6199},
 % year={2013}
%}
    \item \textbf{Linearity Hypotheses (most popular):} Adversarial examples are omnipresent in the data manifold. They occur, because of the very linear behavior of CNNs. (Using ReLU as it's easy to optimize) Small changes of $\epsilon$ in every feature make a resultant change of $\epsilon\|w\|_1$ in prediction. (for $w$ the weights in the linear function)

 % author={Goodfellow, Ian J and Shlens, Jonathon and Szegedy, Christian},
 % journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6572},
 % year={2014}
%}
    \item \textbf{The Boundary Tilting Hypothesis:} Linearity is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain AEs. Instead, AEs mostly result from overfitting the sampled manifold.

 % title={A boundary tilting persepective on the phenomenon of adversarial examples},
 % author={Tanay, Thomas and Griffin, Lewis},
 % journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1608.07690},
 % year={2016}
%}
    \item \textbf{Human-Centric Hypotheses:} ML models make use of predictive but non-robust features. These are features that are highly correlated with the prediction target, but not used by humans.

%}
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Ways to Generate AEs}
There exist various ways in the literature to generate such AEs for a given model in feasible time. We can...
\begin{itemize}
    \item formulate the search for AEs as an \emph{optimization problem}, e.g. 
    \begin{equation*}
        \label{eq:optimization}
        \underset{x'\in X}{\text{argmin}}\; \| x-x' \|+\lambda\;    \vertiii{f(x')-y'}.
    \end{equation*}
    \item use \emph{sensitivity analysis} to find out about features that influence the target class.
    \item train a generative network to generate adversarials for a given model.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, dependent on the model access of the attacker we can distinguish between...
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{White-Box Attacks}: the attacker has full access to the internals of the model.
    \item \emph{Black-Box Attacks}: the attacker can only query the model on some inputs and receives the model's outputs.
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Fast-Gradient-Sign-Method (FGSM)}
We have seen optimization problem approaches already for CEs. Therefore, we focus now on a method using sensitivity analysis, namely FGSM.
\begin{itemize}
    \item FGSM is based on the Linearity Hypotheses.
    \item FGSM finds AEs from:
    \begin{equation*}
        a_x=x+\epsilon\cdot\text{sign}(\nabla_x J(\theta,x,y_{x,true}))
    \end{equation*}
    where $\text{sign}(\nabla_x J(\theta,x,y_{x,true}))$ describes the componentwise signum of the Gradient of cost function $J$ in $x$ with true label $y_{x,true}$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{slides/local-explanations/figure/AEpanda.png}
  \caption{An AE generated with the FGSM}
  \label{fig:mnist}
\end{figure} 
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Fast-Gradient-Sign-Method (FGSM)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item FGSM works particularly well for linear-like models in high-dimensional spaces e.g. LSTMs, logistic regression, CNNs with ReLU activations.
    \item Not every vector generated by FGSM must be an AE, especially if $\epsilon$ is too small.
    \item FGSM-attacks can be also generated without model-access by approximating the gradient i.e. with finite difference methods.
    \item The notion of similarity in FGSM is based on $\|\cdot\|_{\infty}$. However, there exist generalizations of FGSM to other norms.
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}


\begin{vbframe}{Black-Box Attacks with Surrogates}
The biggest threat comes from AEs that can be generated in a black-box scenario. Among these, solution-approaches through surrogates are conceptually most interesting.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Query the model you aim to attack on data similar to the training data.
    \item Use the labeled data you received to train a surrogate model by supervised learning e.g. a CNN.
    \item Use white-box methods (e.g. Gradient-Based-Methods) to generate AEs for the surrogate model for the given optimisation problem.
    \item Use these AEs to attack the original model.
\end{itemize}
Several experiments showed that such attacks are often successful. Papernot et al. call this surprising phenomenon the \emph{Transferability} of AEs.

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Defenses Against AEs}
There are several ways to protect your network against such attacks. We distinguish between two broad types of defenses, differing in the position in which they act.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Guards:} Act on the inputs a model receives. Includes methods to \emph{detect anomalies} (e.g. statistical testing, or discriminator networks from GANs), or \emph{conduct transformations} on inputs (e.g. PCA).
    \item \textbf{Defense by Design:} Act on the employed model itself. Includes methods like \emph{adversarial training} (train model on adversarials) or \emph{architectural defenses} (e.g. removing low-predictive features from the model or imposing layer-wise contraints on output-variance) to make models more robust against AEs.
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Regularization Against AEs}
The use of regularization techniques against AEs is motivated by most hypotheses that explain AEs. One particularly interesting example is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item bsp
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item AEs are not explanations themselves, but are strongly connected to them conceptually.
    \item AEs can be generated in white-box and black-box settings. Crucial modelling-decisions are the distance measure, the local-environment, and the target-level (model or process).
    \item There are various hypotheses on the existence of AEs which also motivate different defense strategies.
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Even in highly non-linear models AEs occur. As long as their existence is not well-understood, defenses against them will have limited power.
    \item More and more different distance measures are considered, e.g. $p_0$ for one pixel attacks, the Wasserstein-metric or psychologically motivated measures like the Perceptual Adversarial Similarity Score (PASS).
    \item Recent work considered AEs that fool both, humans and ML models. AEs may be a case where research on human and machine perception can profit from each other.
