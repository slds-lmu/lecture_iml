% \begin{frame}{Game Theory}
% \begin{itemize}
% \itemsep1em
%   \item Game theory is the study of strategic games between players
%   \item Term \enquote{game} not restricted to actual games (e.g., chess or poker) but to any series of interactions between actors or agents with gains and losses of quantifiable utility value
%   \item Often used in social context where players correspond to people or organizations, e.g., warfare, provision of public goods, auctions and bargaining, formation of cartels, interrogation practices.
%   \item Example of prisoner's dilemma: Two prisoners A and B are interrogated in two separate rooms with no means of communication between each other.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item If they betray each other, each person serves 2 years in prison.
%         \item If one person remains silent and one betrays their partner, person staying silent receives 3 years in prison while betrayer is set free.
%         \item If both remain silent, both serve 1 year in prison.
%     \end{itemize}
%     Conditional on strategy of remaining partner, best personal outcome is achieved by betrayal.
%     \\
%     $\Rightarrow$ Best aggregate outcome not achieved (both staying silent).

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
%\itemsep1em
  \item Game theory is the study of strategic games between players, where \enquote{game} refers to interactions between \enquote{players} involving quantifiable gains and losses
  \item Cooperative games: For all possible players $P = \{1, \hdots, p\}$, each subset of players $\SsubP$ forms a coalition -- each coalition $S$ achieves a certain payout
  %\item A value function $v(S): 2^{|P|}\mapsto \R$ describes the payout (or gain) achieved by any coalition $S \subseteq P$
  \item Value function $v: 2^P\mapsto \R$ maps all $2^{|P|}$ possible coalitions to their payout/gain
  \item $v(S)$ denotes the payout of coalition $S \subseteq P$; payout of empty coalition must be 0 ($v(\emptyset) = 0$). $v(P)$ denotes the total achievable payout.
  %\\
  %\textit{Note:} The payout or gain not necessarily has a positive meaning. In the example of the prisoner's dilemma, the payout is the total number of years spent in prison.
  \item We denote by $\phi_j$ the individual payout of player $j \in P$, referred to later as the Shapley value. 
  \item As some players may contribute differently, we want to fairly divide the total achievable payout $v(P)$ among the players according to a player's individual contribution

  %\item What would be properties of a fair distribution of the payout?

The Shapley value was introduced as summation over sets $\SsubPnoj$, but it can be equivalently defined as a summation of all orders of players: 
%(which explains where the factor $\frac{|S|!(|P| - |S| - 1)!}{|P|!}$ comes from):

$$\phi_j = \frac{1}{|P|!} \sum_{\tau \in \Pi} (v(\Stau \cup \{j\}) - v(\Stau))$$
  
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item $\Pi$: All possible orders of players (we have $|P|!$ in total)

  \item $\Stau$: Set of players before player $j$ in order $\tau = (\tau^{(1)}, \dots, \tau^{(p)})$  where $\tau^{(i)}$ is $i$-th element \\ % j, \dots,

  %\item In order definition, we sum the marginal contribution twice for orders that yield set $S = \{1,2\}$\\
  \item Order definition: Marginal contribution of orders that yield set {\color{red} $S = \{1,2\}$} is summed twice\\

\begin{frame}{Axioms of Fair Payouts}
 Why is this a fair payout solution?
 \\
 One possibility to define fair payouts are the following axioms for a given value function $v$:
  \vspace{0.25cm}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \itemsep1em
    \item \textbf{Efficiency}: Player contributions add up to the total payout of the game:
      $\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^p\phi_j = v(P)$
    % symmetry - "any" confused me a bit since we actually look into coalitions that do not include both j and k. Maybe we can state this more as "for any coalition it make no difference whether we add $j$ or $k$"
    \item \textbf{Symmetry}: Players $j,k \in P$ who contribute the same to any coalition get the same payout: \\ 
      If $v(\Scupj) = v(\Scupk)$ for all $\SsubP \setminus\{j,k\}$, then $\phi_j=\phi_k$
    \item \textbf{Dummy/Null Player}: Payout is 0 for players who don't contribute to the value of any coalition: \\
      If $v(\Scupj)=v(S)\quad  \forall \quad \SsubP \setminus \{j\}$, then $\phi_j=0$
    \item \textbf{Additivity}: For a game $v$ with combined payouts $v(S) = v_1(S) + v_2(S)$, the payout is the sum of payouts: $\phi_{j,v} = \phi_{j,v_1} + \phi_{j, v_2}$
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  

\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Proof of Axioms}
%   The Shapley values fulfills all the 4 axioms.
%   Symmetry, Dummy and Additivity are relatively easy to proof:
% \begin{itemize}
%     % See also: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2747088/shapley-value-is-efficient
%   \item \textbf{Symmetry}: Let's assume coalition $\SsubPnojk$ and $v(\Scupj) = v(\Scupk)$.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Then all marginal contributions are equal: $v(\Scupj) -  v(S) = v(\Scupk) -  v(S), \forall \SsubPnojk$
%         \item Consequently, $\phi_j = \phi_k$.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Dummy}: Let's assume we have player $j$ such that for all $\SsubP$, we have $v(S) = v(\Scupj)$. Then, each marginal contribution of player $j$ is zero, and therefore $\phi_j = 0$.
%   \item \textbf{Additivity}:  Assume two games $v_1$ and $v_2$ and a third game which is the sum of both $v(S) = v_1(S) + v_2(S)$. The marginal contribution for all $\SsubPnoj$ for game $v$ can be expressed as $v(\Scupj) - v(S) = v_1(\Scupj) - v_1(S) + v_2(\Scupj) - v_2(S)$. Since the Shapley value is additive in the marginal contributions, we can split the sum into two sums so that $\phi_{j,v} = \phi_{j, v_1} + \phi_{j,v_2}$.
% \end{itemize}
% Efficiency requires a bit more effort, see proof sketch:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Efficiency}: $v(P)$ exactly appears once per player ($=p$ times) for coalition $S = P \setminus \{j\}$ with the weight $\frac{|P - 1|!(|P| - |P - 1| - 1)!}{|P|!} = \frac{1}{p}$ each. The values for all other coalitions $v(S), \SsubP \{j,k\}$ appear with both minus and plus signs that cancel each other out.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}


% \begin{frame}{Linearity Axiom Corollary}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item The Shapley values are also linear:
%   \item For a game with payout $v(S) = \alpha v_1(S) + v_2(S)$, the Shapley values are $\alpha \phi_{j,v_1} + \phi_{j,v_2}$.
%   \item The multiplication with $\alpha$ works since we can pull out $\alpha$ from the sum of marginal contributions, so that for $v(S) = \alpha v_1(S)$ the Shapley value is $\alpha \phi_{j,v_1}$.
%   \item We already know that Shapley values are additive which proofs the linearity.
